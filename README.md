# Pokémon Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Pokémon data to understand how different attributes, types, and base stats relate to overall Pokémon characteristics. The objective is to explore patterns in the dataset and apply data analysis techniques in a structured exploratory context.

## Analytical Context
Exploratory data analysis is a fundamental step in any data driven workflow, enabling a deeper understanding of data structure, distributions, and relationships. In this project, the Pokémon dataset is used as a practical and well structured dataset to explore statistical patterns, feature relationships, and variability across categories, with a focus on developing and demonstrating analytical reasoning.

## Dataset
Public Pokémon dataset containing information about Pokémon species, types, base stats, and other attributes commonly used for analytical and exploratory purposes.

**Datasource:**  
[Pokémon Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon)

## Analytical Workflow
- Loaded and validated the Pokémon dataset using Python
- Explored distributions of base stats and key attributes
- Analyzed relationships between Pokémon types and statistical characteristics
- Identified patterns and outliers across different Pokémon categories
- Applied exploratory data analysis techniques to summarize findings

## Key Insights
- Base stat distributions vary significantly across Pokémon types
- Certain types tend to specialize in specific attributes
- Exploratory analysis highlights clear patterns and outliers within the dataset

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
